//Goal: Prevent app from EVER locking up; should be as good as Lab4 or better.
//Create functions to load images asynchronously.
//Preferably should be able to run K-Means asynchronously.

///Uses DispatchQueue to run the loadFromURL function asynchronously
func loadImageAsynchronously(){
    //TODO: Implement asynchronous image loading (biggest issue)
}

///Uses DispatchQueue to load colors to palette asynchronously
func runKmeansAsynchronously(){
    //TODO: Run Kmeans asynchronously. Framework is WIP, so don't worry about this one until post-Thanksgiving. 
}

///Creates a custom dispatchQueue
