Name of App: Color+

Description: Our app will allow users to upload or take a photo and then provide them with a color palette based on the colors in the photo. The MVP will consist of the 
ability to take a photo on the app or upload a photo from your phone's photos app and then will provide the 5 most common colors in the photo as the color scheme and will provide 
the hex code values of those colors so that users can use them for design purposes. 
This will help people to choose a desireable text color or sticker color when editing the photo. It will also help users design effective posters and signs when using photos
that will have a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing appearance due our app's color scheme generating abilities. 
Possible additional features for the future (in the semester after the MVP) include: adjusting the saturation of the color scheme, adjusting the brightness of the color scheme, 
changing the number of colors a user wants (a range of 2-10 for example depending on how many they need), displaying the color code in rgb and hex for greater ease of 
future use, possibly adding a second photo and creating a color scheme based on the values of both photos that will be pleasing.
